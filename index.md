### Exposure to the coding club

Last updated on March 16th, 2018

#### Tutorial Aims:

1. Create a coding tutorial and host it on GitHub
2. Set up version control with GitHub and RStudio 
3. Analyse and visualise data using the tidyverse 
4. Create a reproducible report using R Markdown 

You can get all of the resources for this tutorial from [this GitHub repository](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/2018/03/06/tidyverse.html){:target="_blank"}. Clone and download the repo as a zip file, then unzip it.

### Lessons learned

## 1. Create a coding tutorial and host it on GitHub

I created this GitHub page and used the Architect theme. 

1. Create a GitHub repo
2. Create a markdown file called index.md (this is the index.md)
3. Go to your repo settings, scrowl down to GitHub Pages 
4. Change None for master branch for GitHub Pages
5. Optional: choose a theme
6. Refresh the page and go back to the section Github Pages. It will have your page link: `Your site is published at`

## 2. Set up version control with GitHub and RStudio 

Done this on my PC,
I haven't learned much on this part as I did this before, but I definitely recommend Jenny Brian's tutorial Happy Git with R
[http://happygitwithr.com/](http://happygitwithr.com/), it is the best!

## 3. Analyse and visualise data using the tidyverse

Done parts 1, 2 and 3 from the reference link

### Recommendations

1. First, and most importantly, use a project. I will suggest an RStudio project. [It's good practice](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/).
2. This exercise requires a number of packages that you might not need for your analysis. Hence, I recommend using the R package `packrat` which will install packages only for your project. Read more about it [here](https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/).


## 4. Create a reproducible report using R Markdown 

Have a look at part one of the tutorial [https://orchid00.github.io/testCC/tidyverse_report.html](https://orchid00.github.io/testCC/tidyverse_report.html){:target="_blank"}

This is the end of the tutorial. Here is a summary of what what I've learned:
